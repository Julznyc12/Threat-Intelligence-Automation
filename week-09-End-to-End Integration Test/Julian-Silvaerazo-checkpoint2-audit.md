# Checkpoint 2 Readiness Assessment

## Status: AT RISK

The project has strong component-level functionality and tested handoffs, but full end-to-end automation still needs broader validation for reliability, scaling, and edge-case behavior.

---

# What's Working

- **Component 1 (Ingestion):**
  - n8n workflows collect RSS/public threat data and normalize records into Airtable.

- **Component 2 (AI Core):**
  - Flowise/Groq/Hugging Face enrichment produces severity, attack type, IOC extraction, threat summary, and affected software analysis.

- **Component 3 (Specialist):**
  - Relevance scoring and labeling are functioning and update Airtable records.

- **Component 4 (Integration):**
  - Dashboard/interface displays processed records.

- **Handoffs validated in test:**
  - Ingestion → AI Core:
    - new Airtable records are picked up and enriched automatically.
  - AI Core → Specialist:
    - enriched records trigger scoring automatically.

# Critical Gaps (must fix before Checkpoint 2)

- Validate the full end-to-end pipeline so one record flows through all 4 components without manual intervention during scaled runs.

  - **Owner:** Jesus Alvarez / Component 1 + team coordination

- Confirm workflow triggers and Airtable status transitions remain reliable across volume and edge-case inputs.

  - **Owner:** Safayet Safin / Component 4

- Validate Component 3 scoring consistency for diverse threat types and edge-case records.

  - **Owner:** Julian Silva-Erazo / Component 3

- Standardize AI output field mappings and IOC extraction consistency across workflows.

  - **Owner:** Harry Yachimba / Component 2

- Improve API rate-limit handling and retry logic for Groq/Hugging Face calls.

  - **Owner:** Team-wide

# Schema Issues Found

- No major mismatches found yet, but risk remains in these areas:
  - `status` label consistency (`collected`, `pending_analysis`, `enriched`, etc.)
  - `confidence_score` vs. expected `confidence`
  - `IOCs` / `extracted_iocs` naming consistency
  - `recommendations` / `immediate_actions` mapping
  - `Current Status` / `Enriched` / `Relevance Label` workflow semantics

- Ensure all components agree on:
  - ingestion fields:
    - `title`
    - `source`
    - `url`
    - `published_date`
    - `raw_summary`

  - AI fields:
    - `severity`
    - `attack_type`
    - `iocs`
    - `threat_summary`
    - `affected_software`

  - scoring fields:
    - `relevance_score`
    - `relevance_label`

---

# Recommended Fix Order

1. Run one clean end-to-end record through the full pipeline and verify no manual steps are required.

2. Freeze and validate Airtable status values and field mappings used by every workflow.

3. Execute Component 3 scoring validation for edge-case and varied threat inputs.

4. Add focused bad-data and edge-case test records, then rerun the pipeline to confirm stability.

---

# Test Data Gaps

- Missing explicit edge-case records:
  - incomplete or empty `raw_summary`
  - malformed `url` or `source`
  - oversized `alert_text` / `raw_summary`
  - mixed-case or non-standard severity values

- Missing bad-data records:
  - missing required fields like `title`, `source`, or `status`
  - malformed `confidence_score` or `iocs`
  - duplicate records to test deduplication/resilience

- Add example records such as:
  - `title:` missing or blank
  - `url:` `http://example[.]com/bad`
  - `severity:` `high` / `urgent`
  - `iocs` with invalid JSON
  - duplicate alert with same source/date

---

# Summary

The system is close to Checkpoint 2 readiness because the core components and handoffs are operational. The top remaining risk is automation stability under larger volumes and malformed inputs, plus API reliability and schema consistency across all four components still remains a challenge.
