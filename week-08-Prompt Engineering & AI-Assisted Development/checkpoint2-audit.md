# Checkpoint 2 Readiness Assessment

Status: AT RISK

Individual components are producing outputs and partial handoffs are tested, but full end-to-end automation without manual intervention remains unvalidated. The team has a solid foundation but needs focused fixes on integration and testing to meet the "one complete record flows through all 4 components" requirement.

# What's Working

- Component 1 (Ingestion): Successfully collects threat data from RSS feeds via n8n workflows and stores normalized records in Airtable.

- Component 2 (AI Core): Flowise chains are generating correct outputs for threat classification, severity assessment, IOC extraction, attack details, and response recommendations using Groq/Hugging Face APIs.

- Component 3 (Specialist): Partially working relevance scoring and recommendation generation, with some validation completed.

- Component 4 (Integration): Airtable schema, shared workflows, and documentation structure are established for end-to-end validation.

- Partial handoffs: Ingestion to AI Core and AI Core to Specialist have been tested in parts, with records moving between components when manually triggered.


# Critical Gaps (must fix before Checkpoint 2)

- Fully automate the handoff from Ingestion to AI Core so new Airtable records trigger AI Core processing without manual execution (Owner: Jesus Alvarez - Component 1).

- Fully automate the handoff from AI Core to Specialist, including automatic Airtable status updates and field mapping validation (Owner: Harry Yachimba - Component 2).

- Complete validation of Component 3 relevance scoring accuracy and consistency across threat types, ensuring outputs are reliable for prioritization (Owner: Julian Silva-Erazo - Component 3).

- Perform full end-to-end integration testing to confirm one record flows through all components without manual intervention, including error handling and retries (Owner: Safayet Safin - Component 4).

- Finalize Airtable status transitions and field mappings to ensure smooth, consistent workflow handoffs across all components (Owners: All team members, coordinated by Safayet Safin).


# Schema Issues Found

- No major field name mismatches identified yet, but ongoing validation is needed for consistency between Airtable fields, Flowise JSON outputs, and n8n expressions.

- Status values (e.g., "collected", "pending_analysis") are driving handoffs, but ensure all components use the same values without variations (e.g., avoid "pending" vs. "pending_analysis").

- Conventions appear followed (snake_case fields, uppercase severity), but monitor for violations in fields like "confidence_score" (should be "confidence" per schema) and ensure "created_at" uses date fields correctly.

- No specific field names need immediate changes, but audit "extracted_iocs" vs. "indicators" and "recommendations" vs. "immediate_actions" for alignment with the full schema.


# Recommended Fix Order

Validate and automate the Ingestion to AI Core handoff by testing automatic triggering on new Airtable records and fixing any manual steps (1-2 hours: Jesus Alvarez).

Validate and automate the AI Core to Specialist handoff, including status updates and field consistency checks (1-2 hours: Harry Yachimba and Julian Silva-Erazo).

Run a full end-to-end test with one record through all components, documenting any failures or manual interventions needed (1-2 hours: Safayet Safin, with team support).

Add missing test data (see below) and re-test edge cases to ensure reliability (1-2 hours: All team members).


# Test Data Gaps

Current dataset covers common cases (e.g., brute force attacks, malware alerts) but lacks sufficient edge cases, bad data, and volume for robust testing.

Add 5-10 edge case records: e.g., incomplete alert_text (empty or truncated), invalid source URLs, mixed severity levels (e.g., "HIGH" vs. lowercase "high"), and non-standard formats like HTML-encoded text in alert_text.

Add bad data records: e.g., null values in key fields (alert_text: null, source: "unknown"), oversized text (>5000 chars in alert_text), and invalid JSON in extracted_iocs (e.g., malformed arrays).

Increase volume to 20+ records total, including duplicates and varied threat types (e.g., phishing, DDoS) to test workflow scalability and deduplication. Example: Add a record with alert_text: "Suspicious login attempt from IP 192.168.1.1", source: "Internal Logs", severity: "MEDIUM", and ensure it processes through all components.
